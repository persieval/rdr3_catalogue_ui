# rdr3_catalogue_ui

All UI for the catalogues in Red Dead Redemption 2 / RDR2 / RDR3

Working on some things of my own and needed them all in png, so decided to share them with everyone! 

I also included the dds versions, but I did not organise them because rockstar named most of them the same thing and I do not have the brain juice in me to fix that for them. So good luck out there, creatives.
